nodejs-bootcamp
===============

Event Details
What do you need to quickly build a scalable solution in the cloud? You need a powerful time-tested language, a highly robust and elastic cloud infrastructure, and tools to help you deploy efficiently and quickly to the cloud.
We've got good news...
The planets have aligned... You can now create a server-side app on Node.js (frequently referred to by the developer community as the new Ruby on Rails), and deploy it via Cloud9 IDE to Windows Azure Web Sites in a matter of minutes.
On Sept 29, experts from Cloud9, Microsoft, and the developer community join forces on Sept 29, a team or extraordinary folks will show you how to get your first node.js project to the cloud! We have also partnered with one of Denver's hottest technology hub, the Innovation Pavilion to hold this event:
9200 E Mineral Ave, Englewood, CO 80112 

WHAT WILL YOU LEARN?
Our goal is to have you will walk away with a complete end-to-end overview and understanding of how to deploy your node.js app to Windows Azure using Cloud9 IDE. Specifically, you will
be introduced to node.js and understand its strengths, and where and how to apply it to build scalable cloud-based apps
use Cloud9 IDE like an expert to build and deploy your app via the browser of your development machine
learn about the latest offerings from Windows Azure (especially Web Sites) and how to use a program like BizSpark to unlock more resources for your project and startup
